## Defenition

People concider as financial free if their basic spending is balanced out their earning without 
daily work or with minumum daily work (eg less then 4hr/day).

People usually use top 5% as the guideline to state the rich class.
According to Yahoo! Finance, a person concider as rich if they could net $500K per year.
Top 5% in the US making 335k year, and top 1% making 800k/year in 2021.

It might create a wrong impression of to be rich. Because even though
5% income, it could be used up in a short period, created a huge debit.
